# Understanding disaster recovery for IBM Cloud Data Security Broker
{: #sb_dr}

Components of the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} data protection services do not
require any protected data to be stored or cached to operate. This
guarantees that the data is not lost if any {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}
component fails or goes down. In {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} components, only
policy configurations and metadata is stored, and all this data is
recoverable.

It is possible to back up the configurations and metadata stored in a {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment and recover them after a significant outage,
facilitating quick service restoration in a disaster recovery scenario.
This section outlines the procedures for backing up and restoring the
{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment.

## Backup considerations
{: #sb_dr_bkp_considerations}

The following services are required for a complete {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}
deployment:

-   Key management services

-   Database

-   Cloud Object storage

Ensure that the backup schedule for these services align with the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} backups. Additionally, administrators must keep records which are used for linking the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} backup and the backups of the other
services, as well as all backups for the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment
and the above mentioned services, in a secure location.

## Backup procedure
{: #sb_dr_bkp_procedure}

In {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager, all configuration and metadata data
needed for a {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment is stored. {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager's most recent configuration is always accessible to {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shields. As a result, {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager is
the only part of {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} that requires backup.

## Backing up Data Security Broker Manager deployed on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} cluster or ({{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}}) cluster
{: #sb_dr_bkp_dsb_manager}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}  Manager instances running in a Kubernetes cluster or
{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster require network access to the cluster as well as access to the workstation with permission to execute Kubernetes or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} command line tools. Additionally, the workstation must have a directory with write
permissions and sufficient storage to store the backup. 125GB of storage space is sufficient for all deployments.

To take a backup, follow these steps:

1. Access the cluster where {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager is deployed by logging into a Kubernetes or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} workstation.

2. To back up the MongoDB collections and {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager configuration files, create the script provided below and execute it. The location that is specified after the **-b**Â option is where the backup file is kept by the script. Check whether the script is being used to back up a {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager deployment on a {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster or a Kubernetes cluster, and uncomment the relevant command alias for the specified type of cluster where {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager is installed.

3. The following files are added to the specified backup location after you have finished executing the script:

```
Release-DSB.\<release\>MONGO.tar.gz
Release-DSB.\<release\>BM.tar.gz
```
{: codeblock}

4. Transfer the backups of the key management, object storage, and database services related to the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment, as well as the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager backup files, to a reliable backup storage location.

## Restore procedure
{: #sb_dr_restore_procedure}

The {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment can be recovered in a disaster
recovery situation to a state that was previously backed up, provided
that all the dependent services are also recovered in the same manner. This
applies to any services that has suffered a irrecoverable failure. If
the dependent services were not affected, all that is required is to
ensure that the network connectivity between the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}
deployment and the dependent services is restored.

Since {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager contains all the configuration and
metadata needed for a {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment, the goal of the
process is to restore {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager to a previous state
so that a new shield can be deployed to enforce the previously configured security policies.

## Restoring Data Security Broker Manager deployed on a Kubernetes or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster to a previous state
{: #sb_dr_restore_procedure_dsb_manager}

A new {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager deployment needs to be set up in a Kubernetes or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster, in order to return {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager to its previous state. 
The administrator carrying out the restore operation requires network connectivity to the cluster as well as access to a workstation with permission to use the command-line tools for Kubernetes or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster.

To restore a {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} deployment, follow the steps:

1. Log in to the workstation using command-line tools, and use the recently installed {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager to access the Kubernetes or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster.

2. To create a temporary storage area on the workstation, copy the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager backup files there. The names of the backup files includes the following:

```
Release-DSB.\<release\>MONGO.tar.gz
Release-DSB.\<release\>BM.tar.gz
```
{: codeblock}

3. To restore the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager configuration files and MongoDB collections, create and execute the script provided below. As an input to the script, specify the location of the temporary storage location for backup files.

```
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -eq 0 ]

echo "Usage: $0 -m <mongodb backup tar.gz> -b <BM backup tar.gz file> -u

4. Open a new browser tab and log into {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager
    after you have finished executing the script. Verify that the original configurations of the applications, databases, and key stores have been restored.

5. For all of the applications of {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager, with data security policies, deploy new {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shields by adhering to the deployment    procedures. Ensure that the Helm chart is updated with the appropriateÂ Sync IDÂ for each application.

6. Log into {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager after the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield have been deployed to ensure that the newly installed {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shields are in theÂ **RUNNING**Â status.
