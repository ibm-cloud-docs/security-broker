# Data Masking
{: #sb_masking}

## Overview:
{: #sb_mask_overview}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} can enable simplified data
masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information
based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data
exposure in test/dev environments and better control data exfiltration
to external parties.
