# Configure IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS)
{: #sb_hpcs}

In this section, you can find details on how to add [IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-crypto) as a keystore in {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager and configure HPCS.

## Overview
{: #sb_hpcs_overview}

[IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-crypto) offers a cloud hardware security module (HSM) and key management service. It aims to give you control over your cloud hardware security models and cloud data encryption keys as it is the only service in the market built on FIPS 140-2 Level 4-certified hardware.

The HPCS service, which is based on IBM LinuxONE technology, helps to guarantee that only you have access to your keys. Using a dedicated customer-controlled HSM that provides single-tenant key management and key vaulting makes it simple to create encryption keys. You can also bring your own encryption keys to manage instead.

## Procedure
{: #sb_configure_hpcs}

Configure IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services by following the steps below. You can then add IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services as a keystore in {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager.

1. Get an IBM Instance ID in one of the following ways:
    * Using the IBM CLI – enter the following command in a shell window: 

```sh
ibmcloud resource service-instance 'HPCS-DSB-1'
```
{: codeblock}

**Note**: If you are using the IBM Cloud web console, navigate to **Services and Software** and select the HPCS instance. The **GUID** is displayed in the sidebar and the **instanceID** is the same as the **GUID**.
2. Create and retrieve API Key, in the following way: 
    a) Open a  web browser and navigate to [https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
    b) Select **Create an IBM Cloud API Key** and provide a name for the key.
    c) Copy or download the key after it is created.
3. Create Cloud Object Storage in the resource group.
4. Create a Bucket in the COS instance, for example:  **dsb-ibm-bucket**
5. Generate Service Credentials for the COS Bucket.
6. In Object Storage, click on **Service Credentials** in the side panel. Click **New Credential**.
7. Enable **HMAC** and click **Add**.
8. The next step is to add the IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services as a keystore in {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager.


## Add IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services as a keystore in {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager
{: #sb_add_hpcs_DSB}

Use IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services as a keystore in {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager by completing the following steps.

1. Log into {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager.
2. Select **Keystores** from the left navigation and click **Add Keystore +**.
3. Specify a name for the Keystore in the **Keystore name** field and provide a valid description in the **Description** field and select **IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services** in the **Keystore Type** drop-down list.
4. Enter the Instance ID for the KeyProtect Instance.
5. For App Namespace, enter a string to identify the application.
6. For IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services Alias, enter a unique string value.
7. For the IAM API Key, use the key you created.
8. For IBM region, specify the region for the IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance. See [Available IBM region listing](https://docs.baffle.io/v1/docs/configure-ibm-key-protect-and-add-it-as-a-keystore-baffle#available-ibm-region-listing) for more information.
9. For the IBM Cloud Object Storage URL, specify the IBM endpoint URL for COS, for example: https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud
10. Enter the **cos_hmac_keys** for the Access Key ID and Secret Key.
11. Click **Add Keystore**.

**Note** The key will not appear in IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services until the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield has been connected and data encryption has been performed.
