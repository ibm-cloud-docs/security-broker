# About the Software: IBM Cloud {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}
{: #sb_about}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} is a software that makes data breaches irrelevant
by ensuring data remains encrypted, not only when it is stored but also
when it is being processed by databases and applications. {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} provides easy and feasible way to provide enhanced data protection for sensitive data in public or private cloud environments. The software includes dynamic management of customer-owned keys and the ability to
protect databases at a column-level granularity.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} offers Data Protection Services which consists of two main
components, namely:

__{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager__ is the administrative console for
the solution that integrates with enterprise key managers and databases
and manages the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} solution components.

__{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield__ is the SQL / NOSQL proxy that
functions to encrypt and decrypt data at the field or record level.

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager enforces encryption policies and
configurations by:

- Communicating with key management solutions, the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield, and databases.
- Orchestrating configuration and deployment.

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield is a stateless reverse proxy that intercepts
and encrypts application data sent to the database and decrypts encrypted data returned by the database.

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} offers Data Protection Services which provide a range of data protection services such as data encryption, data tokenization, record level encryption, and data masking.

**Note**: {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} supports only PostgreSQL database.

## How it works
{: #sb-how-it-works}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} delivers an enterprise-level transparent data security platform that secures databases through a "no code" model at the field or file level. The software supports tokenization, format-preserving encryption (FPE), and role-based access control. 

The encyrption is made simpler, faster, and seamless.

The {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} supports data encryption by
migrating the data from an existing SQL/NoSQL database into a secure
database with the ability to encrypt fields at a column granularity, thereby enabling selective privacy.

This is accomplished by inserting the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield driver
layer proxy between the application and the database. The Shield is used to intercept
SQL or its NoSQL equivalent generated by the application to access data
records in the database by encrypting on writes and decrypting on reads.

The encryption process manages keys that are generated by a commercially
available key management service such as Key Protect and Hyper Protect
Crypto Service. This change is transparent to the application which will
continue to obtain data from the database in the clear.

Application performance is minimally impacted allowing for enterprise
workflows to continue to operate in a secure environment. The
{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager is the cloud-based management console
providing scalability, fault tolerance, and manageability of the software.

## Encryption Technology Configuration Overview:
{: #sb-encryption-technology-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} supports data protection services that can be configured
in four main modes.

### Data Encryption: 
{: #sb-standard-encrypt}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} functions as an
application-level encryption (ALE) software in this
mode for encrypting data on a field-level basis. This is performed using
{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager to enumerate the data
schema and enable an encryption key mapping.

### Data Tokenization:
{: #sb-data-tokenization}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} supports length
preserving and data type preserving tokenization method to anonymize
data at the field level databases or in semi-structured data files.

### Record Level Encryption:
{: #sb-RLE}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} can be configured
for record level encryption to support multiple keys within a single
column that are mapped to respective data owners or entities. This
encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data
environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode,
data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys
for a respective entity.

### Data Masking: 
{: #sb-data-masking}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} can enable simplified data
masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information
based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data
exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration
to external parties.

## Deployment Plans in IBM Cloud Data {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}:
{: #sb-deployment-plans}

When you assign and customize Default Data Protection Policies with {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager, there are three options that you can choose to
implement your data encryption policy:

### Save Policy:
{: #sb-save-policy}

**Save Policy** option is selected by default. This option confirms your
selected data but does not execute encryption or data protection on your
database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new
policy is saved to overwrite it. You can use the saved policy to deploy
or migrate it later.

### Deploy Policy:
{: #sb-deploy-policy}

**Deploy Policy** option saves your policy and deploys
your configured {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield as a proxy for your
configured database. You can connect to your {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield
endpoint as if it was your database endpoint, to access your database.
Any data that passes through your {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield proxy is
encrypted in your database, if that data is defined in your policy.

### Deploy Policy and Migrate Data:
{: #sb-deploy-migrate-data}

**Deploy Policy & Migrate Data** option saves your policy, deploys it,
and migrates your existing selected tables and columns through the
specified {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield to encrypt them. {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield acts as a proxy for the configured database, and the data
is encrypted as well.

Note: This option is disabled for applications, which does not have a {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield associated with it.

## Key Benefits of {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}:
{: #sb-key-benefits}

- Secure database content throughout the encryption process
- Protect the data with column-level granularity
- Easy key management
- Leverage cloud infrastructure without compromising security
