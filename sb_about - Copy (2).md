# About IBM Cloud Data Security Broker
{: #sb_about}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} is a software that makes data breaches irrelevant
by ensuring data remains encrypted, not only when it is stored but also when it is being processed by databases and applications. 
{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} provides easy and feasible way to provide enhanced data protection for sensitive data in public or private cloud environments. The software includes dynamic management of customer-owned keys and the ability to protect databases at a column-level granularity.
{: shortdesc}

## How it works
{: #sb-how-it-works}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} delivers an enterprise-level transparent data security platform that secures databases through a "no code" model at the field or file level. 
The software supports tokenization, format-preserving encryption (FPE), and role-based access control. 

The encyrption is made simpler, faster, and seamless.

![High level architecture of {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager](images/deploy_architecture.png "High level architecture of {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager"){: caption="High level architecture of {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager" caption-side="center"}

The {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} supports data encryption by migrating the data from an existing SQL/NoSQL database into a secure database with the ability to encrypt fields at a column granularity, thereby enabling selective privacy.

This is accomplished by inserting the {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield driver
layer proxy between the application and the database. The Shield is used to intercept
SQL or its NoSQL equivalent generated by the application to access data
records in the database by encrypting on writes and decrypting on reads.

The encryption process manages keys that are generated by a commercially available key management service such as {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}} and {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. 

Application performance is minimally impacted allowing for enterprise workflows to continue to operate in a secure environment. The {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager is the cloud-based management console providing scalability, fault tolerance, and manageability of the software.

## Encryption Technology Configuration Overview:
{: #sb-encryption-technology-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} supports data encryption services that can be configured
in four main modes.

### Data Encryption: 
{: #sb-standard-encrypt}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} functions as an application-level encryption (ALE) software in this mode for encrypting data on a field-level basis. This is performed using {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager to enumerate the data schema and enable an encryption key mapping.

### Data Tokenization:
{: #sb-data-tokenization}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} supports length preserving and data type preserving tokenization method to anonymize data at the field level databases or in semi-structured data files.

### Record Level Encryption:
{: #sb-RLE}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} can be configured for record level encryption to support multiple keys within a single column that are mapped to respective data owners or entities. This
encryption mode can be used effectively in multi-tenant or shared data environments where segmenting of the data can be challenging. In this mode, data shredding can be enabled by deleting public keys and private keys for a respective entity.

### Data Masking: 
{: #sb-data-masking}

{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} can enable simplified data masking to prevent decryption of data and sensitive file information based on configuration or deleted keys. This mode can minimize data
exposure in public cloud environment and provides a better control of data exfiltration to external parties.

## Deployment Plans in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Data {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}}:
{: #sb-deployment-plans}

When you assign and customize default Data Protection Policies with {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Manager, there are three options that you can choose to
implement your data encryption policy:

### Save Policy:
{: #sb-save-policy}

**Save Policy** option is selected by default. This option saves your selected data, but does not execute encryption or data protection on your database. Your policy remains saved with the application until a new policy is saved to overwrite it. You can use the saved policy to deploy or migrate it later.

### Deploy Policy:
{: #sb-deploy-policy}

**Deploy Policy** option saves your policy and deploys your configured {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield as a proxy for the configured database. You can connect to your {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield endpoint, as if it was your database endpoint, to access your database.
Any data that passes through your {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield proxy is
encrypted in the database, if that data is defined in your policy.

### Deploy Policy and Migrate Data:
{: #sb-deploy-migrate-data}

**Deploy Policy & Migrate Data** option saves your policy, deploys it, and migrates your existing selected tables and columns through the specified {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield to encrypt the data. 
{{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield acts as a proxy for the configured database, and the data is encrypted as well.

This option is disabled for applications, which does not have a {{site.data.keyword.security_broker_short}} Shield associated with it.
